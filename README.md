# Daniel-Quiz!

## Description
I was tasked create a functional quiz that is timed and uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.

I was motivated to undertake this task because I wished to gain a greater understanding of how to use JavaScript to manipulate HTML and CSS.

## Solve
The completion of this project provides the user with a functional timed quiz that they can take to test their knowledge on basic JavaScript.

The webpage is now deployed for use.

## I have learned:
* How to store objects within an array in localStorage, and retrieve them.
* how to set multiple object within an object variable.
* How to manipulate HTML and CSS (the DOM) using JavaScript.
* How to create and append elements to the HTML document.
* How to set attributes such as style to add CSS using JavaScript.
* How to set text content and inner text to created elements using JavaScript.

4. Use the git command `git clone` followed by the URL copied from Github to clone the repo to our machine.
5. The `git clone` command creates a new directory with the same name as the repository. We navigate into our new directory using `cd`.
6. The repository should now be cloned onto your device and able to be edited in VScode or another editing software.
